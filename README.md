# coreos-mgr

A CoreOS Cloud Init management webservice

## Usage

1. Visit https://coreos-mgr.not.implemented.com
1. Enter your S3 keys and bucket
1. Create a `cloud-config.yaml` template
1. Provide a host set in the form `myhost-{1..10}` or `myhost-a myhost-b`
1. Initialize machines with `coreos-cloudinit --from-url="https://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<hostname>"`

## Notes

* It's recommended that you set your machine's `HOSTNAME`, so you only need to replace `<hostname` with the shell replacement `${HOSTNAME}` in the command above.
* This is a pure client-side JavaScript application, there is only the GitHub file server, your keys are only sent to AWS. You can confirm this in your browser's developer tools.

## Todo

* etcd discovery service viewer
